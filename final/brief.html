    <h3>For my final project, I will be implementing my Every Picture project with better quality of images with more interactions.</h3>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal for this project is to bring more attention to the collage of film images I made and present individual images with a description in a user friendly way. One thing that wasn’t accomplished in my Every Picture project was showcasing a high resolution images, especially for the collage image. In order to fix this, I plan to scan my image again to a .iff file format with 300 dpi whereas my first one was scanned as a jpg file and place it with a larger width and height because there’s a big difference when the image is small and big.</p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p> want to create a different, better layout of the overall design so that the users can feel more connected and understand my film journey. I will be showing the collage image in a bigger dimension and each image would slide in from the side when it is clicked. I want to add some animation so that the transition can be smooth and interactive. I will be keeping the font that I used earlier. Since I am going to add some short descriptions for each image, I will be also focusing on typography hierarchy.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>The main interaction this project has is clicking each sections of thumbnails. In order to encourage users to interact with the project, I want to improve on how to make those sections stand out so that the users know they can click them and see what happens next. As I stated earlier, I am also planning to add some animation to make the visual more interesting and cohesive.</p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>I hope to show my passion in film photography to the users who visit my website. I hope they can find the charms in film photos. By clicking each thumbnail and observing full images, I want to show my viewpoint/perspective and what I see. Not all pictures have a special story, but I hope they get to me better while having fun exploring my project.
